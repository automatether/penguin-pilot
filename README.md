## Our solution

Our team has developed a solution that allows the crew to monitor the current energy cosumption, generation and storage on the ship.

In practice the solution is a web application that can be accessed by the crew or other relevant personnel. Providing the app with historic data starts the prediction model. The model is then used to predict the energy consumption, generation and storage, as well as calculate anomalies and other events.
